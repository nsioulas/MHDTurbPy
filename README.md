# MHDTurbPy

A bunch of functions that I use to download, clean and analyze data from the Parker Solar Probe, Solar Orbiter, Helios and Ullyses missions. More documentation coming soon.

Feel free to reach out for questions: nsioulas@g.ucla.edu.
Also, feel free to add your functions and contribute to this repository.
